## Book Description
If you are looking to extend your iOS programming skills beyond the basics then More iPhone Development with Objective-C is for you. Authors Dave Mark, [Jayant Varma](http://www.oz-apps.com), Jeff LaMarche, Alex Horovitz, and Kevin Kim explain concepts as only they can—with code snippets you can customize and use, as you like, in your own apps.

More iPhone Development with Objective-C is an independent companion to Beginning iPhone Development with Objective-C. That is, it is a perfect second book, but it is also a great book for those looking to improve their skills who have already programmed for iOS. In particular it includes a series of chapters devoted to Core Data, the standard for Apple persistence. The authors carefully step through each Core Data concept and show techniques and tips specifically for writing larger apps—offering a breadth of coverage you won’t find anywhere else.

More iPhone Development with Objective-C covers a variety of other topics, including Multipeer Connectivity’s relatively simple Bluetooth/WiFi peer-to-peer model, MapKit, and media library access and playback so that your applications can utilize media on your users’ computer. You’ll also find coverage of Interface Builder, Live Previews and Custom Controls and some advanced techniques for debugging your applications. The book is filled with useful topics that will bring your programs up-to-date with the new functionality built into iOS.

## What you’ll learn

 * How to embed maps with Map Kit and use in-application email
 * How to access a user’s iPod music library and integrate music into apps
 * Working with data from the web and the cloud, including Apple’s iCloud
 * Using the Camera to integrate into your apps, scan and create barcodes
 * Live previews from Interface Builder to create custom components and frameworks

## Who this book is for

This book serves as a complementary book to More iOS 6 Development: Further Explorations of the iOS SDK and is suitable for those aspiring app developers new to iPad app development. Prior Objective-C programming experience would be helpful, but not required.
